# Giant Bomb app

- This app interacts with the Giant Bomb API.
- This project primarily exists as a venue for me to learn iOS developement and SwiftUI.
  - If you really want an iOS app to browse Giant Bomb, there are better options out there already on the App Store.

## Setup

You need a `Development.xcconfig` file that's set with the following environment variables:

- `GB_API_KEY` - The API key used to authenticate with the Giantbomb API
- `GB_API_URL` - The base url for the Giantbomb API
